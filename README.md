## My process

This project involved using custom JavaScript to determine where the users mouse pointer was and to manipulate the CSS with that JS. Flex boxes are also used to make a dynamic layout between desktop and mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript



### What I learned

I learned a lot about manipulating CSS with JavaScript and the many customizations you can make to create a reactive web page.

### Continued development


I will continue to work on my implementation of flex boxes and JS in my frontend development.
